          <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
          <p>
            The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very
            close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the
            port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer,
            comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz. Close by and
            situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with
            modern standard and with its own popular restaurant. Both the port
            and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird
            islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”. The coastline
            south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and
            invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car. North,
            and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well
            soothed for a nice swim. The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö
            is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to Stora
            Karlsö (4nm). For more information, check out the websites:
            lillakarlso.org and storakarlso.se. For information about Djupvik
